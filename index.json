What are the effects of the European green transition on inequality? We answer this question using a heterogeneous-agent model with non-homothetic preferences for energy and non-energy goods, calibrated to European data. We study the impact of an increase in carbon taxes designed to meet the EU target under different revenue-recycling strategies. Redistributing tax revenues via uniform transfers reduces consumption inequality, shifts the welfare burden to high-income households, but leads to significant output losses. Subsidizing green energy producers boosts energy production, reduces output losses, and requires a smaller carbon tax to meet the EU target. However, it increases consumption and income inequality, with the highest welfare costs borne by low-income and asset-poor households. Our findings highlight key trade-offs between equity and efficiency in green transition policies.\nAuthors:\nGuido Ascari Andrea Colciago Timo Haber Stefan Wöhrmüller ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9610eed7baaab921d65372e80b44cf73","permalink":"https://timohaber.github.io/current_work/ascari_colciago_haber_woehrmueller/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current_work/ascari_colciago_haber_woehrmueller/","section":"current_work","summary":"The EU aims for 42.5% green energy consumption by 2030.

First, large monetary policy shocks should yield proportionally larger initial responses of the price level. Second, in a high trend inflation regime, the response of the price level to monetary policy shocks should be larger and real effects smaller. Our analysis provides evidence supporting these non-linear effects in the response of the price level in aggregate US data, indicating state-dependent pricing as an important feature of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.","tags":[],"title":"Non-linearities, state-dependent prices and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://timohaber.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
