What are the effects of the European green transition on inequality? We answer this question using a heterogeneous-agent model with non-homothetic preferences for energy and non-energy goods, calibrated to European data. We study the impact of an increase in carbon taxes designed to meet the EU target under different revenue-recycling strategies. Redistributing tax revenues via uniform transfers reduces consumption inequality, shifts the welfare burden to high-income households, but leads to significant output losses. Subsidizing green energy producers boosts energy production, reduces output losses, and requires a smaller carbon tax to meet the EU target. However, it increases consumption and income inequality, with the highest welfare costs borne by low-income and asset-poor households. Our findings highlight key trade-offs between equity and efficiency in green transition policies.\nAuthors:\nGuido Ascari Andrea Colciago Timo Haber Stefan Wöhrmüller ","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"9610eed7baaab921d65372e80b44cf73","permalink":"https://timohaber.github.io/current_work/ascari_colciago_haber_woehrmueller/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current_work/ascari_colciago_haber_woehrmueller/","section":"current_work","summary":"The EU aims for 42.5% green energy consumption by 2030.

Examining the Compustat universe of firms, we find that this pro-cyclical left-skew is concentrated on very largest companies in the market. Smaller firms exhibit much less skewness in growth rates when hit by adverse shocks. Furthermore, using a factor decomposition, we show that not the shocks themselves, but rather the reactions of firms to shocks exhibit skewness. We rationalize these observation in a simple framework of a profit maximizing firm. A version of Marshall’s second law of demand implies that price setting firms react to shocks with left-skewed output growth rates, while price taking firms respond symmetrically. Furthermore, left-skewness is increasing in the degree of market power and in the standard deviation of the shock. In light of our model, left-skewed downside risk is not a consequence of disaster shocks, but the result of monopolization and market power.\nAuthors:\nFrederik Bennhoff Timo Haber Niklas Schmitz ","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"0908fa6099c099fbe7f26853146e7766","permalink":"https://timohaber.github.io/current_work/bennhoff_haber_schmitz/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current_work/bennhoff_haber_schmitz/","section":"current_work","summary":"Firm growth rates in times of crisis take are strongly negatively skewed (Salgado et al, 2019).

First, large monetary policy shocks should yield proportionally larger initial responses of the price level. Second, in a high trend inflation regime, the response of the price level to monetary policy shocks should be larger and real effects smaller. Our analysis provides evidence supporting these non-linear effects in the response of the price level in aggregate US data, indicating state-dependent pricing as an important feature of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.","tags":[],"title":"Non-linearities, state-dependent prices and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://timohaber.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
