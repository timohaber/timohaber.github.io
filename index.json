If you have any suggestions for how to make the scale as accessible as possible, please feel free to contact me (nick@nickballou.com). ️ About BANGS The Basic Needs in Games (BANGS) is an open-access, free to use scale that assesses video game players’ degree of need satisfaction and frustration. This questionnaire can be used to help understand how players experience a video game, and predict outcomes such as game enjoyment, engagement, in-game behavior, and well-being.\nBANGS includes 6 subscales covering satisfaction and frustration of all three basic needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness; see below). Three variants of BANGS have been validated for use, with slightly different wordings to cover particular game sessions, experiences with one game over time, or experiences with gaming in general.\nWhy BANGS? Players’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are among the most commonly used constructs used in research on what makes video games so engaging, and how they might support or undermine user wellbeing. However, existing measures of basic psychological needs in games have some important limitations:\nThey either do not measure need frustration (which has emerged as a common and impactful experience in games distinct from the absence of need satisfaction), or measure it in a way that may not be appropriate for the video games domain They struggle to capture feelings of relatedness in both single- and multiplayer contexts They often lack validity evidence for certain contexts (e.g., playtesting vs experience with games as a whole). BANGS attempts to address these limitations and others. For more details on how it does so, we encourage you to read the validation paper.\nBackground: Self-determination Theory Basic psychological needs are a concept from self-determination theory1. Decades of theory and evidence support the idea that humans have innate and universal needs for:\nAutonomy: the need to feel a sense of control over one’s life and volitional in one’s actions Competence: the need to act effectively and exert mastery in the world Relatedness: the need to feel that one is connected to and valued by others More recent research has shown that satisfaction of these basic psychological is different from their frustration. Need frustration is not simply the absence of need satisfaction, but a separate construct referring to feelings of being controlled or coerced (autonomy frustration), failure and self-doubt (competence frustration), or loneliness and exclusion (relatedness frustration). Evidence suggests that need satisfaction and need frustration are separate experiences that can coexist to varying degrees.\nThe degree to which activities satisfy or frustrate our basic psychological needs has two main consequences for us: (1) it affects our motivation, and therefore our behavior, and (2) it affects our mental health—how much our activities support us in living a full and flourishing life.\nFor motivation, when activities satisfy our basic psychological needs, people tend to be more autonomously motivated to perform those activities—doing them because they are either inherently enjoyable, or because they align with one’s authentic values. When activities frustrate our basic psychological needs, people tend to lose motivation, or (if other factors mean that stopping the activities is a less viable option) continue to perform the activity in an inflexible way.For mental health and wellbeing, when activities satisfy our basic psychological needs, people tend to feel better both during and after the time they spend doing them.\nIn the world of video games, basic psychological needs have been studied extensively, with research showing that they are key ingredients in what makes games ‘fun’2. For example, games may satisfy autonomy through allowing people to build desired avatars customization, satisfy competence by providing them rich feedback about their improvement over time, or satisfy relatedness by providing a social space for players to connect with friends and family through shared attention.\nIn short, basic psychological needs are an important consideration for game designers trying to find out what makes their games engaging, for user researchers trying to understand how people behave in games, and for researchers trying to find out when and why games affect players’ mental health.\nBANGS Items BANGS consists of the following items. Please see this Excel file for complete variants of the questionnaire.\nConstruct Label Item Autonomy Satisfaction bang_01 I could make choices regarding how to play [X]. bang_02 I could play [X] in the way I wanted. bang_03 I could direct my own play experience in [X].

Theirs is an excellent scale and example of how to make research outputs accessible, and we highly encourage you to check it out! ️ The Scale The Basic Needs in Games (BANGS) is an open-access, free to use scale. You can use it to understand how players experience a game or gaming in general. However, to ensure good measurement and fair comparisons, it is important to use the scale as devised.\nBelow, we provide a few tips. This is not meant to be guide on how to conduct surveys or how to perform statistical analysis of results. For more general information on conducting survey studies, I point you in the direction of a few useful resources at the bottom of this page.\nIf you are comfortable with player experience measurement, quick-start templates can be found here Excel file.\nHow to use What order should the items be in? We strongly recommend randomizing the order in which items appear. This allows you to better use multiple items to measure the same underlying thing (i.e., the three autonomy satisfaction items) without it being overly obvious or tedious for participants who would have to otherwise fill out several similar items in a row.\nWhat are the response options? BANGS was designed using a 7-pt Likert scale with the following format:\n1 - Strongly disagree 2 3 4 - Neither agree nor disagree 5 6 7 - Strongly agree In one study, we tested an alternative format where the numeric values were changed to range from -3 to +3, instead of 1 to 7. We did not find any evidence that this affected the validity of the measure, so if you feel this better represents your goals with measuring basic needs, this is an alternative option. However, because the majority of our research used a 1 to 7 scale, the -3 to +3 variant should be used with some caution.\nHow do you fill in the blanks? BANGS was tested for three kinds of usage:\nExperiences of a particular game session Experiences of a particular game over time Experiences of gaming in general over time It’s important to be explicit about which of these you are interested in, and measure appropriately. For each, you will need to update the stem text and the placeholder [X]s in each item to suit the context. The table below summarizes the changes you’ll need to make. Fully-updated variants are available in the Excel file.\nVariant Stem Text Replacement for placeholder [X] Particular game session Throughout my session of the game… “the game” Particular game Throughout my experiences playing [name of game]… [name of game] Gaming in general Throughout my experiences playing games in the last [time period]... “the games I played” OR remove [X]s entirely (untested) Scoring If possible, we recommend calculating factor scores based on players’ responses to each item, or using a measurement model—this allows you to account for the fact that each item gives a different amount of information about the underlying construct. Research shows that these scores typically differ somewhat from simply taking the mean of each subscale, and that this can have an appreciable impact on your results.\nIf this is not feasible or convenient, we recommend simply using the mean of all items in each subscale (e.g., the mean of items 1, 2, and 3 for autonomy satisfaction; items 4, 5, and 6 for autonomy frustration, and so on).\nDepending on your research interests, it may be appropriate to calculate the mean of all the need satisfaction items (i.e., satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and the mean of all need frustration items (i.e., frustration of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) as holistic indications of people’s overall need satisfaction and frustration. Note, however, that this will result in the loss of information about which needs are more satisfied or frustrated.\nWe do not recommend calculating a score of all 18 items together (e.g., subtracting the mean of all need frustration items from the mean of all need satisfaction items)—need satisfaction and frustration are separate constructs with different consequences, and are therefore best handled separately.\nGeneral Resources for Conducting Survey Studies Kelley, K., Clark, B., Brown, V., \u0026amp; Sitzia, J.

I’m generally happy with the result, and I figured if I could cut down on others’ frustration by sharing what I did, that’s the least I could do. I have no web design experience and struggled throughout with HTML/CSS/Go, as well as with the general structure of the website. In other words, if I can do it, so can you!\nThe full codebase for my website is available on Github.\nThese alterations often failed to work out of the box for me when borrowing others’ code, and they similarly may not work for you. Due to differences in1) Wowchemy versions and idiosyncratic parts of your setup, and 2) poor documentation on my part after too many hours of trial and error, these tips are more about pointing you in the right direction with sources rather than directly solving your problems. Setting up your site These tips assume that you already have a working, deployed version of a Wowchemy site. This is too large a topic to dive into here, but some of the resources I found helpful when first doing this include:\nDan Quintana’s blog post on creating your website Andreas Handel’s post on creating a website in under an hour Wowchemy’s own tutorial/guide (duh) Basics of Wowchemy/Hugo Customization Customizations to your Wowchemy site typically take one of 4 forms:\nChanging a predefined parameter in the config/_default files (mainly params.yaml and config.yaml) Altering a theme in data/themes - for exmaple, I created a file data/themes/my_theme.toml where I set all of the colors for both light and dark mode across the website. I can highly recommend Coolers for trying out different color palettes until you find one you’re happy with. Adding/changing a partial—essentially a bit of code that defines a certain design feature on your website. For example, partials might define where your profile picture appears, the number of columns used to display the content of a given page, the presence of a background image, and much more. Using partials was by far the hardest part of Wowchemy for me to wrap my head around. By default, partials are defined in your theme, and can be found under themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/modules/wowchemy/v5/layouts/partials (I know, it really feels like they could’ve simplified that folder structure a bit). You should never alter these files in the theme itself. Instead, you should make a copy of partials, and put them in a new folder at the root of your directory: layouts/partials. The partials in your root directory will override the “default” ones in the theme, allowing you to change the design without risking breaking anything—you can always just delete the custom partial. Changing the styling with custom SCSS code (which is just CSS code, but fancier). You can add a file called custom.scss inside assets/scss folder (again, you may need to create this folder first). Within this file, you use CSS code to specify certain elements/classes of elements, and can change their visual properties. This might include the formatting of your headings, various colors or padding, animations (see below), and much more. If you master these four strategies for customizing your website, you’ll have the main tools in your toolkit for making your website stand out from the crowd. As above, it’s beyond the scope of this post to teach you how to do each of these things thoroughly, but here are some resources that helped me:\nThe basics of predefined parameters: Dan Quintana’s blog post on creating your website Getting to grips with custom.scss: Connor Rothschild’s blog post Understanding how partials work: noisyoscillator’s post on customizing Hugo websites; Yorkyard’s getting started with Hugo partials Setting up a Blogdown site from scratch, with lots of custom tweaks, by Mark Druffel Changes on my site About widget The about widget is the first thing your visitors are going to see, and therefore was the aspect I spent the most time customizing. Each of the changes I made is detailed below.\n(Re)move interests/education for a cleaner homepage This alteration was inspired by Matteo Courthoud’s site, and he also wrote his own helpful tutorial on how to achieve similar results. To do so, I copied the about.html partial from the theme (found at themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/modules/wowchemy/v5/layouts/partials/widgets/about.html) and put it into the folder for customized partials (layouts/partials, in this case inside a layouts/partials/widgets subfolder mirroring where it was found in the theme).\nDon’t be alarmed if you open up this file and are immediately overcome by a sense to burn the whole thing to the …","date":1670976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681430400,"objectID":"8be668f0b287fb9512f7e6fba16e4ce8","permalink":"https://timohaber.com/blog/custom-wowchemy/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/custom-wowchemy/","section":"blog","summary":"Notes from far too long spent googling around for tips on customizing this Wowchemy site","tags":[],"title":"Miscellaneous Tips for Customizing your Wowchemy Academic Site","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
